# toearnfun_flutter_app

**ToEarnFun** is a **fit to earn** Web3 smart fitness application. Compared with other **x-to-earn** applications that only have **SocialFi** and **GameFi** elements, it can be connected with real smart fitness equipment. It relies on the encryption technology of the hardware chip to ensure that the sweat is paid fairly. The entry-level users of **ToEarnFun** do not need to purchase cryptocurrencies, but only need to purchase smart fitness equipment adapted to the application, and they can **fit to earn** immediately, greatly reducing the difficulty for ordinary users to enter the web3 world.
